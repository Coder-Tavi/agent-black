A bot used to manage bans of multiple servers.

For more Information, please contact **Phil | Flipper#3621**.

Please do not ban people without context. We need a tangible reason under someone’s ban, we can’t just have a list of bans which have zero context to them. That defeats the purpose of this bot. Please do not use Dyno to ban. Dyno no longer adds ban reasons to the ban list. So, if you were to ban someone with a reason with Dyno, the ban reason will not be given to the bot and no context will be recorded. Other bots should work fine, you can even use the Agent Black itself a!ban <UserID> <reason>. Agent Black currently doesn’t work with tags, just IDs. 

Please don’t ban people for no valid reason. By that, I don’t mean just ban people who you don’t like or ban people with an unjustified reason. By using this bot, you agree that you will consider bans objectively, that means don’t consider your personal feelings on the subject. Be professional with the ban feature, be thorough; we don’t want to see ban reasons that are false. Don’t sugar coat ban reasons, don’t exaggerate, and don’t lie. 

Don’t ban discord bots; and if you remove Agent Black from your server, please have the decency to notify us.
