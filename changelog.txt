**Changelog:**
__Bot update - 3.0.0 - Discord-App-y-fyed the bot__
New Stuff:
- A new command to retrieve user banners

Important Changes:
- completely remade agent-black with the new slash-commands (complete remake of backend)
- the help comamnd has been stripped down to just display a simple message to now use the build in slash command help provided by discord (Temporary)
--> **You now need use the slash commands to interact with the bot**
- Ban command removed: Discord already provides a Ban command with the same functionality EDIT: Ban reason correction cannot be done this way, so a implementation of the old ban command will come
- Free-Search for user tags has been disabled temporarily as not working properly with slash commands

Boring Bug Fixes:
- Updated dependencies to new versions
- added failsafe to not demote own maintainer account
- Now using genrelized embed colors for easyer coding
- Better error handling with output in support server for devs to stop issues more quickly

Planned for the Future:
- Hard mode: kick/ban everyone on global ban list; kick every unverified bot;...
- everything else
